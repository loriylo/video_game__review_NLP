# video_game__review_NLP

With video games being in abundance and game console technology getting better and better, video game journalists are constantly writing game reviews about the latest video games at any given moment. Sometimes, readers may just want a quick opinion on whether or not to buy a video game. They may want to see related video game reviews or maybe even the genre which they belong to. Additionally, some readers may be visually impaired or have some other form of disability that requires some audio component when browsing the web. As such, we choose to focus on text summarization, text classification in terms of video game genres, and speech synthesis in order to help facilitate video selection for buyers as well as to elevate market penetration for sellers.
A transparent and automatic analyzing and classifying system is needed, yet few seriously consider it in academia. For future market analysis research and for more people to accurately pick the right video games, we propose a system which performs video game review text collection from IGN review website, text summarization and classification on the review, and finally performs text-to-speech. The result will be displayed on a specific website showing a gameâ€™s summary, visualized recommendation, and speech synthesis.

Our project design

There will be a final website where a user submits a link to an IGN video game review: From here, we web scrape the review There will be 3 different models used 

The first will summarize the review 
The second will classify it as "recommended" or "not recommended" 
The final model will perform speech synthesis
